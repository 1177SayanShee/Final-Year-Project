    <p>
        <strong>Plant Disease Detector</strong> is a web-based application crafted to assist farmers, botanists, and agriculture enthusiasts in accurately identifying plant leaf conditions using machine learning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our application specifically distinguishes between <strong>Early Blight</strong>, <strong>Late Blight</strong>, and <strong>Healthy</strong> leaf conditions. By simply uploading a photo of a plant leaf, our intelligent model analyzes the image and predicts the type of disease affecting it â€” if any.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This timely diagnosis empowers farmers to take appropriate and swift action to prevent crop loss, enabling better yield and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The underlying model is trained using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to ensure accurate and fast predictions. Whether you are an experienced farmer or just stepping into agriculture, this tool is designed to be intuitive and helpful.
