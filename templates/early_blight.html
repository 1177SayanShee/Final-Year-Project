    <h2>Early Blight Treatment Guide</h2>
    <p>
        Early blight is caused by the fungus <strong>Alternaria solani</strong>, which survives in soil and plant debris. It thrives in warm temperatures, high humidity, and alternating wet and dry conditions. Proper management is key to controlling this disease.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention Measures:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris immediately to reduce fungal spores.</li>
        <li>Apply fungicides such as <em>mancozeb</em>, <em>copper oxychloride</em>, or those containing <em>fluopyram</em> as soon as symptoms appear. Always follow the product label instructions.</li>
        <li>Use disease-free seeds or seed tubers to avoid introducing the fungus into your field.</li>
        <li>Practice crop rotation yearly to break the disease cycle and reduce soil contamination.</li>
        <li>Choose potato varieties with resistance or tolerance to early blight whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Maintain plant health by providing proper fertilization, irrigation, and pest control to reduce stress susceptibility.</li>
        <li>Harvest crops in dry conditions to minimize disease spread.</li>
        <li>Sanitize gardening tools regularly, especially pruning shears, and avoid working on plants when wet.</li>
        <li>Improve air circulation by pruning or staking plants to reduce humidity around foliage.</li>
        <li>Use mulch to prevent soil spores from splashing onto leaves during watering or rain.</li>
        <li>Water plants at the base rather than overhead to keep foliage dry and discourage fungal growth.</li>
    </ul>
