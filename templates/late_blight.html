    <h2>Late Blight Treatment Guide</h2>
    <p>
        Late blight is caused by the fungus <strong>Phytophthora infestans</strong>, which thrives in cool, moist environments and can quickly devastate potato crops. Effective management combines resistant varieties, sanitation, and fungicide use.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention Measures:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Destroy infected plants completely to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
        <li>Apply fungicides such as <em>metalaxyl</em>, <em>fluopicolide</em>, or protectants like <em>mancozeb</em> according to local extension recommendations.</li>
        <li>Do not compost infected plant material; instead, dispose of it safely.</li>
        <li>Remove volunteer potato plants that can harbor the pathogen.</li>
        <li>Space plants properly and prune to improve airflow, reducing humidity around foliage.</li>
        <li>Ensure proper soil drainage to avoid waterlogging which favors fungal growth.</li>
        <li>Use balanced fertilization to keep plants healthy and more resistant to infection.</li>
        <li>Harvest potatoes promptly and store tubers in a cool, dry place to prevent post-harvest infections.</li>
        <li>Sanitize tools and avoid working on wet plants to reduce spread.</li>
        <li>Consider copper-based fungicides or horticultural oils if organic options are preferred.</li>
    </ul>
